# Hello, I'm Manel! Welcome to my Github!

## About Me
I'm a Game Developer, proficient using Unity and with great knowledge of C++, trying to make my passion for videogames into a career in the industry. My fondness and care for the art of making videogames came from many, many hours playing and equally as many hours spent on watching videos on the topic, such as some very inspiring teachers that never stop encouraging me to go further.

- From Porto, Portugal üó∫
- Studying Game Design at Instituto Polit√©cnico de Bragan√ßa üïπÔ∏è

## Skills
- **Languages:** Proficient using Unity and C++

## Projects
Here are some notable projects I've worked on:

### Bloodsv√¢nia
In this project I had to develop animation-based combat, so it proved a challenge for me at first! With a lot of tries and figuring out the best way to do it, I was able to achieve my goals and created something I was proud of! https://github.com/ManelNeon/Bloodsvania

### SDL Tetris Prototype
First project I did using C++! Made a tetris prototype using only SDL! I centered this project around pointers as I thought they were an important skill I needed to acquire! https://github.com/ManelNeon/LearningCPP/tree/main/SDLTetris

## Education
### Instituto Polit√©cnico de Bragan√ßa - ESACT
- **Game Design** (2022 - Present)

### ISTEC Porto
- **Mobile Device Development** (2019-2021)

## Experience

### Employee at McDonald's (Sep 2021 - Feb 2022)
A year off studying, to see if I really wanted to follow game development! Had this year to work on my social skills and organizational ones too! McDonald's proved efficient at that, even excelling among my peers as a great people person!

### Internship at 3Decide (Mar 2021 - Jul 2021)
An internship at 3Decide where I was still looking for my role in the game development world. Here I practised more of my 3D Modelling skills, having learnt 3DS Max for the first time! All in all a great experience to have, and even implemented those same models on an engine!
